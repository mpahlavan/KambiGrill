Reasoning and Assumptions:
Assumptions:
We assume the existence of appropriate timestamps in the data (e.g., order timestamp, preference timestamp).
We assume that necessary data is available for creating relationships and deriving meaningful insights.
Reasoning:
We designed a star schema for simplicity and performance in query operations.
We leveraged appropriate dimensions and fact tables to answer the specific analytical questions.
Some questions may require advanced analytics or data mining techniques not covered by SQL alone.


Reasoning and Assumptions:
The data warehouse design follows a star schema to simplify queries and optimize performance.
Time dimensions facilitate analyzing data over different time intervals.
Customer preferences are assumed to be part of the "Customer Dimension".
The design assumes integration of data from various sources to calculate and derive meaningful insights.
"Order Status" in the "Orders Fact" provides information about the order progress.
Assumptions are made about the availability and structure of existing data for analysis and reporting.
